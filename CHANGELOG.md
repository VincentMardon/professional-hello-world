# Changelog

All notable changes to **Professional Hello World** will be documented in this file.

The format is loosely inspired by [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)  
and this project adheres (ironically) to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

---

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-31

### Added
- Initial repository structure for a totally disproportionate project.
- `README.md` setting the satirical/enterprise tone of the platform.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` describing a distributed salutation system far more complex than reality.
- `docs/assets/` to host the official coding cat visual identity.
- GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) to ensure the pipeline can say hello professionally.

### Notes
- No actual “Hello, World!” has been rendered yet.
- This is intentional: architecture must always precede greeting.
- Future releases will introduce real features such as:
  - multi-language hellos,
  - observability of greetings,
  - and dark-mode greetings.

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Frontend landing page: “PROFESSIONAL HELLO, WORLD! — Coming soon…”
- Django/DRF backend exposing `/api/greetings/default/`
- CLI client for terminal-based salutations
- CI steps for linting, testing and building
- Optional Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint counting greetings per minute
