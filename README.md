## ⚠️ Disproportionate project ⚠️

This project is about learning DevOps and monitoring skills and ... Yeah, the program just display "Hello, World"!

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

The system is composed of multiple microservices communicating over HTTP,
each responsible for a unique and highly specific task — mainly ensuring that
"Hello, World!" is properly displayed across platforms and time zones.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this 100% mission-critical repository  
2. Deploy the backend with Kubernetes (obviously)  
3. Install 37 dependencies  
4. Finally, display "Hello, World!"
